## Problem

How can I prove my IRL contacts and engagement at conferences and events. How can companies see who attends their events and functions regularly, who is already networking with employees in the company, or how far their employees are networking with others. How can I reward people who network a lot, are at conferences, events and online spaces regularly and support/know me and my company or are in contact with my employees often.

## Solution

Simply exchange your contact information via a QR code or NFC card/sticker and give your new contact an NFT as a memento of your meeting. This way you can see when you have met everything and better remember your new contacts. At the same time, the NFTs show his engagement at events and how well you are connected. Using this information, companies and event organizers can provide you with additional benefits in the form of discount codes and invitations. For companies, important information is provided with which they can more easily identify their target group, build customer loyalty and recognize how well you are networked. The NFT technology makes the whole process secure, non-manipulable and transparent.
